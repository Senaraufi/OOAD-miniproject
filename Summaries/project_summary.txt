### Music Shop Management System - Project Summary
========================================

Project Overview
---------------
This project develops a Music Shop Management System in Java with reference to OOP concepts. It provides the functionalities of browsing and finding, buying, and organizing music albums and CDs by using mainly a line interface and a graphical window.

Package Structure
---------------
The project is organized into 7 packages:
1. Model: Contains the core business logic classes
2. GUI: Contains the graphical user interface components
3. Enums: Contains enumeration types
4. Exceptions: Contains custom exception classes
5. Interfaces: Contains interface definitions
6. Main: Contains the application entry point
7. Resources: Contains application resources (images)

Class Hierarchy
--------------
1. Abstract Classes:
   - Product: Base class for all purchasable items
     - Defines common attributes (name, price, imageFileName)
     - Implements Purchasable interface

2. Interfaces:
   - Purchasable: Defines contract for purchasable items
     - Methods: purchaseItem(), returnItem()

3. Sub Classes:
   - Album: Extends Product
     - Additional attributes: artist, genre
   - CD: Extends Product
     - Additional attributes: artist, genre, numberOfTracks, duration

4. Regular Classes:
   - Customer: Manages customer information and purchases
   - Sale: Records sales transactions
   - ShoppingCart: Manages shopping cart functionality
   - Main: Application entry point
   - MusicShopGUI: Main GUI window
   - AlbumListCellRenderer: Custom renderer for album list display

5. Exception Classes:
   - PurchaseLimitException: Handles purchase limit violations

6. Enum Classes:
   - Genre: Defines music genres (ROCK, POP, JAZZ, etc.)

Key Features
-----------
1. Product Management:
   - Support for different types of music products (Albums, CDs)
   - Product details include name, price, artist, genre

2. Shopping Features:
   - Shopping cart functionality
   - Purchase limit enforcement
   - Sale recording
   - Product returns

3. User Interface:
   - Graphical User Interface with:
     * Product browsing
     * Cart management
     * Checkout process
   - Command-line interface for testing

4. Error Handling:
   - Custom exceptions for purchase limits
   - Proper validation of operations

Design Patterns Used
------------------
1. Inheritance: Product -> Album/CD hierarchy
2. Interface Implementation: Purchasable interface
3. Model-View Separation: Separate packages for business logic and UI

How It Works
-----------
1. Initialization:
   - System loads with predefined albums and CDs
   - Creates a customer instance
   - Initializes shopping cart

2. Purchase Flow:
   - User browses available products
   - Adds items to shopping cart
   - Reviews cart contents
   - Proceeds to checkout
   - System validates purchase against limits
   - Creates sale records
   - Updates inventory

3. Error Handling:
   - Checks purchase limits
   - Validates cart operations
   - Provides user feedback

4. GUI Implementation:
   - Shows available products with images
   - Displays cart contents
   - Shows total price
   - Provides feedback messages

Object-Oriented Principles Demonstrated
------------------------------------
1. Encapsulation:
   - Private fields with public getters/setters
   - Protected access where appropriate

2. Inheritance:
   - Product hierarchy
   - GUI component extension

3. Polymorphism:
   - Product/Album/CD relationships
   - Interface implementation

4. Abstraction:
   - Abstract Product class
   - Purchasable interface

Object-Oriented Programming Elements:
1. Final Class Implementation
   - Main class is declared as 'public final class Main'
   - Prevents inheritance, ensuring class behavior integrity
   - Serves as the application entry point

2. Super Class & Inheritance
   - Product serves as the super class
   - Album and CD classes inherit from Product
   - Demonstrates proper inheritance hierarchy

3. Enums
   - Genre enum (ROCK, POP, JAZZ, CLASSICAL, etc.)
   - Role enum (MANAGER, SALES_ASSOCIATE, etc.)
   - Provides type-safe enumeration

4. Abstract Class
   - Product is implemented as an abstract class
   - Contains abstract methods for child classes
   - Enforces consistent implementation

5. Private Members
   - Extensive use of private fields and methods
   - Examples: private final List<Product> items in ShoppingCart
   - Ensures proper encapsulation

6. Package Organization
   - Main: Application entry point
   - Model: Business logic classes
   - GUI: User interface components
   - Enums: Enumeration types
   - Interfaces: Contract definitions
   - Exceptions: Custom error handling

All required Object-Oriented Programming elements have been successfully implemented in the project, demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of OOP principles and their practical application.
